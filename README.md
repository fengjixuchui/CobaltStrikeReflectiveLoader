# BokuLoader - Cobalt Strike Reflective Loader
Cobalt Strike User-Defined Reflective Loader written in Assembly & C for advanced evasion capabilities.

![](/images/top2.png)

+ Based on Stephen Fewer's incredible Reflective Loader project: 
  + https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection
+ Created while working through Renz0h's Reflective DLL videos from the [Sektor7 Malware Developer Intermediate (MDI) Course](https://institute.sektor7.net/courses/rto-maldev-intermediate/) 

## Versions
+ Different version of this User-Defined Reflective Loader project can be found in the versions folder

| Version | File | Description |
|:-------:|:-----|:------------|
|0.7|BokuLoader-v0_7.c| Updated to work with Cobalt Strike v4.5! |
|0.6|ReflectiveLoader-v0_6.c| NoRWX feature added! The Reflective loader writes beacon with Read & Write permissions and after resolving Beacons Import Table & Relocations, changes the .TEXT code section of Beacon to Read & Execute permissions |
|0.5|ReflectiveLoader-v0_5.c| Added HellsGate & HalosGate direct syscaller, replaced allot of ASM stubs, code refactor, and ~500 bytes smaller. Credit to @SEKTOR7net the jedi HalosGate creator & @smelly__vx & @am0nsec Creators/Publishers of the Hells Gate technique! Credit to @ilove2pwn_ for recommending removing ASM Stubs! Haven't got all of them, but will keep working at it :) |
|0.4|ReflectiveLoader-v0_4.c| AMSI & ETW bypasses baked into reflective loader. Can disable by commenting #define BYPASS line when compiling. Credit to @mariuszbit for the awesome idea. Credit to @\_xpn\_ + @offsectraining + @ajpc500 for their research and code |
|0.3.1|ReflectiveLoader-v0_3_1.c| Changed strings from wchar to char and unpack them to unicode with MMX registers. Fixes linux compilation error discovered by @mariuszbit |
|0.3|ReflectiveLoader-v0_3.c| String obfuscation using new technique. |
|0.2|ReflectiveLoader-v0_2.c| Checks the Loader to see if dependent DLL's already exist to limit times LoadLibrary() is called, custom GetSymbolAddress function to reduce calls to GetProcAddress(), and code refactor. |
|0.1|ReflectiveLoader-v0_1.c| This is the original reflective loader created for this project. It includes the notes within the C file. This initial version was created with research and learning in mind. Little obfuscation and evasion techniques are used in this version.|

## Usage
1. Start your Cobalt Strike Team Server with or without a profile.
2. Go to your Cobalt Strike GUI and import the BokuLoader.cna Agressor script.

3. Generate your x64 payload (Attacks -> Packages -> Windows Executable (S))
  + Does not support x86 option. The x86 bin is the original Reflective Loader object file.

4. Use the Script Console to make sure that the beacon created successfully with this User-Defined Reflective Loader
  + If successful, the output in the Script Console will look like this:

## Build (Only tested from macOS at the moment)
1. Run the compile-x64.sh shell script after installling required dependencies
```bash
# Install brew on macOS if you need it (https://brew.sh/)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
# Install Ming using Brew
brew install mingw-w64
# Clone this Reflective DLL project from this github repo
git clone https://github.com/boku7/BokuLoader.git
# Compile the BokuLoader Object file
cd BokuLoader/
cat compile-x64.sh
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -c BokuLoader.c -o BokuLoader.o -shared -masm=intel
bash compile-x64.sh
```
2. Follow "Usage" instructions
